# AIについて
## 定義
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems. These processes include learning (acquiring information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using the rules to reach conclusions or make decisions), problem-solving (finding solutions to complex or ambiguous problems), perception (interpreting and understanding sensory input like images or text), and natural language understanding (comprehending and generating human language).

AI systems can be designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and adapting to new situations. AI technologies include machine learning, which involves training algorithms on large datasets to enable them to improve their performance over time, and deep learning, a subset of machine learning that involves artificial neural networks capable of learning and representing complex patterns.

AI has a wide range of applications, spanning from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, financial analysis, gaming, and more. The field of AI continues to evolve, with researchers and engineers exploring new techniques and approaches to create increasingly sophisticated and capable AI systems.
